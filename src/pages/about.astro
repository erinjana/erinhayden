      <p>
        I’ve spent more than twenty years teaching, raising kids, and working
        alongside families through life’s many transitions. I was even a
        childbirth educator and labor doula once upon a time. But that’s a story
        for another day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of my experience comes from classrooms and leadership roles. Some
        of it comes from my own kitchen table.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am the parent of a child with multiple chronic medical conditions, and
        I’ve participated in both IEP and 504 planning as an educator and as a
        parent. I’ve taught and raised children while navigating special
        education and medical systems in five different states. That experience
        has given me a wide-angle view of what works, what doesn’t, and where
        collaboration often gets stuck.
      </p>

      <p>
        This blend of professional training and lived experience helps me
        recognize strong systems when they’re in place—and find practical,
        creative solutions when they fall short.
      </p>

      <p class="emphasis">
        At the heart of everything I do is a simple belief: people deserve to
        feel supported, respected, and understood, especially when systems feel
        overwhelming.

      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        My work began in classrooms, where I taught students from preschool
        through college. Over time, I stepped into leadership roles, including
        serving as the head of a Special Education department. I later earned my
        PhD in Literacy Education to deepen my understanding of how learning,
        language, and access shape student experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, I teach in the School of Education at Purdue University Fort
        Wayne, where I focus on literacy, community building, research, and
        preparing future educators for real classrooms with real students and
        real challenges.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work has always extended beyond schools. As a parent, advocate, and
        professional, I’ve spent years supporting people during moments that
        carry a lot of weight—education planning, medical decisions, legal
        paperwork, and major life changes. That path eventually led me to become
        a commissioned mobile notary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notary work may look different from teaching or advocacy, but it comes
        from the same place. Many documents that require notarization are tied
        to stressful or time-sensitive situations. I approach that work with
        care, discretion, and attention to detail, knowing that for the person
        sitting across from me, the paperwork often represents something much
        bigger.
      </p>

      <p>
        Across all of my roles, the goal remains the same: to help people move
        forward with clarity and confidence.
      </p>

      <h2>Bravery Books & Advocacy Through Writing</h2>
      <p>
        Bravery Books grew out of my belief that stories matter. They shape how
        we see ourselves, how we see others, and how we imagine what’s possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through both fiction and nonfiction, my writing centers inclusion,
        disability representation, and the power of community. I write stories
        that reflect real kids and real families—messy, resilient, thoughtful,
        and brave. Whether I’m writing for young readers, teens, or adults, my
        goal is to create books that help readers feel seen and understood.
      </p>

      <p>
        Writing is also one of my favorite ways to advocate. Stories open doors
        that policy language can’t. They invite empathy, spark conversation, and
        help people connect across difference.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to writing, I’m available for school visits, classroom
        talks, and community events. I love working with students to foster a
        genuine love of reading and writing and to help them see themselves as
        storytellers. Visits can be tailored for different ages and focus areas,
        including literacy, storytelling, inclusion, and building strong
        classroom communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re interested in author visits, speaking engagements, or learning
        more about my work, I’d love to connect.
