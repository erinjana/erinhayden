        <h1>About Erin Hayden</h1>
        <p class="lead">Educator, Writer, Advocate, and Founder of Bravery Books.</p>
        
        <p>With over a decade of experience in education and a lifetime of personal advocacy, I am dedicated to creating spaces where everyone belongs. My work bridges the gap between policy and practice, ensuring that individuals with disabilities are not just accommodated, but celebrated.</p>
        
        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>My path began in the classroom, where I saw firsthand the challenges students with diverse needs face. This inspired me to pursue further expertise in special education and eventually launch my consulting practice. I believe that education is the most powerful tool for social change.</p>
        
        <h2>Advocacy & Writing</h2>
        <p>Through my writing and speaking engagements, I aim to shed light on the nuances of disability rights. Whether it's op-eds, blog posts, or my upcoming book projects, my goal is to foster empathy and understanding.</p>
