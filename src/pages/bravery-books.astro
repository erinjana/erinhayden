            <p>
              Welcome to Vista del Vino, a cozy mystery series set in Southern
              California wine country, where rolling vineyards, small-town
              traditions, and close-knit communities hide more secrets than they
              let on.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the heart of the series is Casey Nolan, a smart, determined
              amateur sleuth and anxiety-ridden single mom doing her best to
              hold everything together. When life pushes her to start over,
              Casey returns to wine country seeking the comfort of her mother’s
              cooking, familiar rhythms, and extra support while raising a
              teenage son with multiple chronic illnesses.
            </p>

            <p>
              Between school schedules, medical routines, and the everyday chaos
              of parenting, Casey finds herself repeatedly pulled into mysteries
              no one else seems eager to solve. With the help of her diabetic
              alert dog—and later, a devoted PTSD service dog whose instincts
              are as sharp as her own—Casey follows clues through farmers’
              markets, festivals, kitchens, and vineyards, proving that real
              life doesn’t pause just because murder has entered the scene.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Vista del Vino Mysteries blend beloved cozy mystery
              tropes—small-town secrets, found family, food and wine, quirky
              locals, and an amateur sleuth with heart—with thoughtful,
              authentic representation of chronic illness, caregiving, and
              mental health. These stories honor the realities of parenting a
              medically complex child while celebrating resilience, humor, and
              the power of community support.
            </p>

            <p>
              Step into The Sugar Squad Chronicles, a heart-filled middle grade
              adventure series about friendship, courage, and finding your
              strength—even when life throws curveballs.
            </p>

            <p>
              The series begins at Camp Sweetwater, a summer camp for kids with
              diabetes, where lifelong friendships are forged around campfires,
              inside jokes, and shared experiences. Led by Grayson and his
              tight-knit group of friends, the Sugar Squad learns that managing
              diabetes is just one part of who they are—their bravery, kindness,
              and loyalty matter just as much.
            </p>

            <p>
              As the series unfolds, readers follow the Squad beyond camp and
              into the real world. From navigating family changes, bullying, and
              sibling separations to balancing sports, school, and chronic
              illness, each book explores what it means to grow up when life
              doesn’t always follow the plan. Along the way, the Squad tackles
              mysteries, road trip adventures, and moments of deep emotional
              reckoning—learning when to step up, when to lean on each other,
              and when to ask adults for help.
            </p>

            <p>
              Later books expand the world of the Sugar Squad, taking readers on
              a cross-country road trip, into national parks and cultural
              landmarks, and back to Camp Sweetwater, where new counselors, old
              traditions, and unresolved questions test the bonds of friendship.
              With empathy at the forefront, the series thoughtfully addresses
              family illness, mental health, social justice, cultural awareness,
              and loss—always through the lens of hope and connection. The Sugar
              Squad Chronicles blend beloved middle grade tropes—found family,
              summer camp adventures, mysteries, teamwork, and growing
              independence—with authentic representation of kids living full,
              adventurous lives with diabetes. These are stories where bravery
              looks like speaking up, listening closely, and standing together.

                In a sport where toughness is everything, fifteen-year-old Shea
                knows she can skate with the best of them—if they’ll let her.
                After missing official tryouts, she earns a spot on a
                competitive co-ed travel hockey team through a late evaluation.
                But from the moment she steps on the ice, it's clear her new
                teammates aren’t exactly thrilled to have a girl added to the
                roster—especially one who's ready to challenge the status quo.
              </p>

              <p>
                Jayden has enough to worry about without team drama. Between
                pressure to keep up his grades and the daily challenge of
                managing Type 1 diabetes in secret, he's focused on surviving
                the season, not making waves. But when Shea joins the team,
                everything shifts. Resentment builds, rumors swirl, and tensions
                rise as both players find themselves on the outside.
              </p>

              <p>
                As the season barrels toward the state championship, Shea and
                Jayden must each decide who they are, both on and off the ice.
                One plays through pain. The other plays through silence. But
                when it matters most, they might just be what the team needs to
                pull together.
              </p>

              <p>
                Told in dual POV, Five Minute Major is a character-driven YA
                sports fiction novel about identity, teamwork, gender bias, and
                the pressure to perform.

                story of Frederick Banting, who was a medical researcher and so
                much more! He was also a brave war hero and a talented painter.

                Frederick's journey starts on a quiet farm in a small town in
                Canada, where he learned the value of hard work and
                responsibility. But as he grew up, he dreamed of doing something
                bigger than running the farm like his family wanted him to do.
                Along the way, he faced incredible challenges, like failing in
                his first year of college and surviving World War I.
              </p>

              <p>
                Frederick's life was far from ordinary. He didn't just become a
                doctor—he became a medical pioneer! He discovered how to make
                insulin, a life-saving medicine for people with diabetes. Can
                you believe it? His work changed the world and has saved
                millions of lives over the past 100 years.
              </p>

              <p>
                This book will take you on an adventure, filled with stories of
                courage, discovery, and the power of never giving up. Frederick
                Banting's life is proof of what one person can achieve with
                determination and a heart full of compassion. Get ready to be
                inspired by this incredible man who made the world a better
                place for millions of people around the world!

          Copy) reviewer. Dive into new worlds before anyone else and help Erin
          ensure that every story she shares resonates deeply with readers
          around the globe. She is often looking for adult beta readers with an

        <h3 class="mt-md text-accent">What is a Beta Reader?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong> Beta readers are crucial to the book development
          process, providing feedback on manuscripts before they are finalized. As
          a beta reader, you’ll get an early look at raw versions of manuscripts and
          have the opportunity to suggest improvements related to plot, character
          development, and structure.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Influence book development</li>
          <li>Enhance your reading experience by seeing behind the scenes</li>
          <li>Improve your own writing and analytical skills</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-md text-accent">What is an ARC Reader (or Listener)?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Description:</strong> ARC reviewers receive nearly final versions
          of books before they are released to the public. These may come in print,
          ebook or audio, depending on what the author is looking for feedback on.
          Your role is to read the book and prepare a review that can be published
          on platforms like GoodReads, Amazon, or your personal blog upon the book’s
          release.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>

          <li>Help build buzz around upcoming releases</li>
